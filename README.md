# CS50-problems
This repository contains the problem sets I worked while taking Harvard's CS50\
The first weeks were focused on C, with a cs50 library that offered an easier way to deal with user input, and some "training wheels" to facilitate C to beginners\
Later on the course we got rid of the "training wheels" and started working more like "the real world"\
**Week 1:** Introduction to C\
**Week 2:** Arrays\
**Week 3:** Algorithms\
**Week 4:** Memory(Image and sound manipulation)\
**Week 5:** Data structures\
**Week 6:** Python\
**Week 7:** SQL\
**Week 8:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript\
