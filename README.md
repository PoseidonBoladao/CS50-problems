# CS50-problems
This repository contains the problem sets I worked while taking Harvard's CS50\
The first weeks were focused on C, with a cs50 library that offered an easier way to deal with user input, and some "training wheels" to facilitate C to beginners\
Later on the course we got rid of the "training wheels" and started working more like "the real world"
